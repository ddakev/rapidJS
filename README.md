#RapidJS
RapidJS is a Javascript library for _rapid_ 2D game development. It provides classes and methods for most generic features of game development and streamlines the game creation process.
##Usage
To use the library, include the following code in the head of your web page:  
`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddakev/rapidJS/master/rapid.js"></script>`
##Documentation
For information on how to use the library, please see the documentation in the repo.
##Functionality
Currently, the library includes the following classes and their respective methods:
- **RapidGame** - main game-driving class
- **GameObject** - class for a generic game object
- **Collider** - class for defining polygon colliders for game objects
- **Animation** - class for frame-based spritesheet animation for game objects
- **Scene** - class for scenes, which include game objects
##Future
When finished, the library should provide all the necessary elements for basic 2D game creation in Javascript. Current plans are to extend the Animation class to handle more types of animations, improve keyboard and mouse event handling and extend the functionality of game objects by adding more components that can be added to them.
